    <p>My path to NIT Agartala has been anything but straight. My passions were all over the place and I used to be extremely indecisive.</p>

<p>It all started with this exam called KVPY. KVPY seemed interesting. It could prove to be my gateway to research. But guess what? I hated math to death. So, I wanted to go with PCB because biology was alot more my jam. Now everyone has this one typical Indian uncle or aunt that is hell bent on influencing your life’s career choices. For me, this was my maternal uncle. He said, “PCM it is,” he declared, “more opportunities.” He was right, of course, but man, did I hate math. So, we compromised, a glorious mishmash - PCMB. I was the only one in my entire class to have taken up this combination, a true science outlier.</p>

<p>Big mistake, turns out my bio teacher was a super-strict, grade-slaying pro. No mercy, even for Darwin’s grandson! My biology grades were abysmal and my math scores were shockingly decently high for my expectations. And I wasn’t facing any regrets. That is, until life threw me a curveball in the last year of my school life. Let’s just say things got messy, and I had to take a drop year. Now, here’s the thing about dropping for NEET: it’s like a domino effect. Everyone thinks they need multiple attempts, and guess who fell for that trap? Yep, yours truly. Two attempts and two failures. I felt unbearably dejected. But here’s what this journey taught me. There’s always a silver lining, awaiting.</p>

<p>Enter JEE 2021. The paper of my shift turned out to be a twisted kind of lucky. Even a low score was enough because, well, the paper was brutal. And voila! I landed at NIT Agartala. Sure, it wasn’t the smoothest ride, but hey, here I am. A ridiculously roundabout route, you might say, but it’s mine. Now, the question is, what kind of engineer will this indecisive, biology-loving, math-tolerating mess of a person become? Stay tuned, because the story is just getting started.</p>

<p>The irony wasn’t lost on me. The first taste of college life, the fabled freedom, had come during the most isolating time – the tail end of the pandemic. Lectures on muted screens, exams a click away from Google’s embrace – it was a strange kind of beautiful. Sure, I’d craved normalcy, the end of the soul-crushing lockdown that had stolen two years of my youth. But as I finally stepped onto the NIT Agartala campus, a different kind of anxiety gnawed at me. The online semester had been a paradox. A refuge from the relentless pressure of academics, yes, but also a breeding ground for a different fear – the fear of exposure. Hidden behind the anonymity of a darkened screen, I had thrived. Anonymity bred audacity, and audacity translated to a stellar 9.27 GPA, a score I wouldn’t have dared dream of in the pre-pandemic world. The truth is that I’d barely studied, relying on the magic of mute buttons and strategically placed textbooks to bluff my way through exams.</p>

<p>But the jig was up. The thrill of online trickery was a distant memory, replaced by the cold fear of real classes and the judgement of real professors. The social awkwardness that had simmered beneath the surface during online interactions now felt like a raging inferno. I found myself swallowed by the sea of unfamiliar faces. Making friends seemed like scaling Mount Everest – an impossible feat.</p>

<p>This self-doubt bled into every aspect of my college life. The pressure to land a coveted job, the constant feeling of being on the precipice of failure – it all felt suffocating. Every day was a battle against an existential crisis, a looming question mark hanging over my years in college.</p>

<p>Yet, amidst the despair, there were glimmers of hope. The hesitant smiles exchanged with Diya and the easy camaraderie I shared with Chaitanya. These small connections, forged in the crucible of shared anxieties, were my life rafts. And then there was the quiet determination that flickered within me. With a deep breath, I decided to embrace the unknown. The silence might have been deafening, but it was also a chance to start fresh, to rewrite my narrative and find my own definition of success, one small step, one genuine connection at a time.</p>

<p>College life for me wasn’t quite the vibrant explosion depicted in movies like “Happy Days.” It was a far cry from the carefree friendships and constant activity. The two-year online stint due to COVID had left a void, making real-life connections even harder. 
One such instance was one of the first NLC meet-ups I ever went to. There, I knew only Nancy, who was busy with her own group. So, I ended up being stranded. An opportunity to join others for food presented itself, but my introverted nature held me back. I retreated to my phone, missing out on the chance to interact with new people. It was a stark reminder of the online semester’s limitations – it hadn’t fostered friendships or the confidence to initiate them.</p>

<p>But I realised I couldn’t keep isolating myself.  During a second interaction at the Gymkhana room, I encountered Chaitanya. Unsure of how to start a conversation, I stumbled with the first question – “Where are you from?” Chaitanya replied, “Bihar.”  A past prejudice against people from Bihar almost shut down the conversation entirely. But determined to change my ways, I pushed forward.</p>

<p>We discovered that we lived on the same floor and started initiating conversations. A debate competition became a catalyst. Though it wasn’t a major event, I performed well and bonded with more people. The camaraderie with Chaitanya grew stronger. This year’s Alcheringa stands out to me, as a particularly cherished memory. Unlike last year’s boring train journey, this experience with Chaitanya was engaging and fun. It highlights how these small interactions, especially those with Chaitanya and Diya, have been the building blocks of my college memories. I think there is something to be said about the power of pushing your comfort zone. College life may not be a constant party, but by taking those small steps, like joining others for food or participating in events, beautiful memories can be forged.</p>

<p>An unexpected turn of events also propelled me into a leadership role I never saw coming. It all started with MUN (Model United Nations) Society.  While MUN experience was lacking on my resumé, my friends believed that I was the ideal person to lead the club’s creation. Hesitant at first, I found myself at the helm of a passionate group. The initial ideation phase was a collaborative effort, and I heartily acknowledge the immense contribution of the other members.</p>

<p>The success of the club’s first flagship MUN - NITAMUN was a revelation. I hadn’t anticipated the scale of the event, and was blown away. This experience, along with the journey of creating the MUN society, have become defining moments in my college life.  It wasn’t just about the club; it was about the dedication of my friends, the power of teamwork, and the ability to achieve something remarkable despite the challenges. For me, the MUN story encapsulates the essence of my college experience – unexpected turns, supportive friendships, and the satisfaction of overcoming obstacles. It is a testament to the fact that even the most introverted person can find leadership and purpose through the collective spirit of a passionate group.</p>

<p>Talking about the differences in culture that NIT Agartala has given me the opportunity to experience, unlike a lot of my South Indian friends, I didn’t experience much of a culture shock here. Growing up in a Kendriya Vidyalaya with a diverse student body had prepared me for the mix of cultures I’d encounter in college.</p>

<p>However, college brought an unexpected surprise. While I felt comfortable with my heritage, I soon realized that my northern counterparts had limited exposure to South Indian customs.  A casual conversation about potentially marrying my cousin’s daughter left them speechless. It was a reminder that cultural exchange is a two-way street.</p>

<p>I am a big believer in the underrated potential of NIT Agartala. I acknowledge the excellent infrastructure, like the new RNT hostel, and appreciate the ongoing efforts to improve the campus. While I find the natural beauty undeniable, I believe it could be better maintained.</p>

<p>Movies and exploring new interests have been a bright spot here, in college. Cricket is my icebreaker, and finding Chaitanya who shares my passion for Hollywood movies, especially lesser-known titles, has been a highlight. Binge watching “World War Two in Color,” together has been a core memory.</p>

<p>Diya’s arrival in my life has marked a turning point. Despite my reservations about commitment, Diya’s unwavering support during my existential crises have chipped away at my cynicism. Her intelligence and ability to hold engaging conversations are a refreshing change from my past relationships.  For the first time,I’ve felt a genuine connection that challenges my preconceived notions of love. Diya’s presence has brought a sense of stability and hope, and while cautious, I seem to be cautiously opening myself to the possibility of love.</p>

<p>I would also like to mention Gayatri akka, who became my shield against ragging. Her intervention saved me from many a harrowing experience.  This unexpected act of kindness from a senior became a bright spot in my otherwise guarded perception of senior-junior interactions.</p>

<p>I have a way of remembering my past. I associate specific songs with different phases of my life. For instance, a song I heard in 2019 triggers memories of that time. College life is no different.  Each semester has its own soundtrack.  One particularly difficult semester, my fourth, is forever linked to the song “Wasted.” Music is a powerful tool for me.  While my taste leans towards classic artists like Michael Jackson, I appreciate a good love song too.  Diya even teases me for my old-school tastes.</p>

<p>College life has also brought opportunities for shared laughter. These experiences, both awkward and amusing, paint a picture of my evolving relationships and my growing understanding of the world around me.  As I navigate college life, I shed my initial inhibitions and embrace the richness of cultural exchange.</p>

<p>I aspire to be remembered as a kind and supportive friend, especially for those who have faced struggles similar to mine. I envision myself as a mature and understanding boyfriend to Diya. And I acknowledge that different people perceive me differently. My Telugu friends see me as someone who challenges stereotypes, while Divyam might view me as Muslim and I embrace all these diverse interpretations.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, my dream is to enter politics and create a youth-driven party. I envision a new generation of leaders replacing the current bureaucratic structure. While this is a long-term goal, my immediate objective is to crack the UPSC exam. I acknowledge the challenges – my lack of political connections and limited financial resources – but my determination remains strong.  I see the UPSC exam as a gateway, the first step towards achieving my larger political ambitions.</p>

<p>While my time at this college might be coming to an end, my journey that began from Vizag has got a long way to go!</p>

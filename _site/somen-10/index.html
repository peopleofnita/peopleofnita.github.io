    <p>It’s fascinating to look back at how much the world of engineering and technology has changed over the years.</p>

<p>When I started my journey, engineering was much simpler here, with just three main branches and about 125 seats available for students. The internet was just finding its feet, and the IT sector was taking its first steps in India. We didn’t even have a computer branch back then - it was introduced later as technology started becoming more important in our daily lives.
Those early days were challenging in their own way. Unlike today, where information is at our fingertips, we had to work extra hard to stay connected with what was happening in the technology world. There was no external support system - you had to figure things out on your own. But there was something special about that time too. If you graduated from a government college, your joint entrance rank meant something during interviews and the merit spoke for itself. The way companies hire fresh graduates has changed dramatically too.</p>

<p>These days, private colleges have stepped up their game, investing in state-of-the-art infrastructure and modern labs. I remember when IBM hired fresh graduates from a private institution simply because they had mainframe lab facilities that even some NITs didn’t have. Companies now expect colleges to prepare students better - they want graduates to hit the ground running, with at least 25-30% theoretical knowledge ready to apply. Gone are the days when companies would spend a year or two training fresh graduates.
My own career journey started during a particularly tough time. Like many others in my batch, I faced the uncertainty that came after the 9/11 attacks. Many of us had job offers in hand, only to see them postponed or cancelled. It was a time of emotional turmoil - hopes and dreams suddenly put on hold. Some of us joined smaller organizations, while others waited until 2002 for things to stabilize.</p>

<p>I started my career in Hyderabad, working with network connectivity for drilling machines. It wasn’t exactly what I had dreamt of doing, but sometimes life takes unexpected turns that lead to better paths. During college, I had picked up some computer skills, assembling and selling computers to local businesses to earn extra money. Little did I know this side hustle would lay the foundation for my IT career.</p>

<p>The real turning point came in 2002 when I joined Wipro through an off-campus drive in Kolkata. They put me in their cloud and storage division - a field I knew nothing about. Initially, I was more excited about the prospect of training in Malaysia than the actual work. But a wake-up call from my trainer, who pointed out my lack of engagement, changed everything. That feedback lit a fire in me. Within a year, I had completed their advanced architectural training and became a certified storage architect.</p>

<p>Back in India, I dove deep into client projects, explaining storage solutions and data center management. As cloud computing emerged, I found myself working across South Asia, handling projects for both government institutions and corporate clients. These experiences taught me more than just technical skills - they showed me how technology could transform organizations.
After spending a decade at Wipro, I moved to IBM to lead their mainframe storage team in Bangalore. This role brought new challenges - building a team from scratch, recruiting fresh talent, and managing the transfer of significant workloads from the US to India. It wasn’t easy, but we made it work.</p>

<p>One of the most memorable moments in my career came during a crisis at Mindtree. Their data center had crashed completely, and I spent an entire night rebuilding their system from scratch. The incident caught the attention of top leadership, including Azim Premji. It taught me an important lesson: while luck plays a part, what really matters is your willingness to face challenges head-on.
By the time I was 28, I was managing operations across Eastern India and neighbouring countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan. This rapid progress came with its own lessons - particularly about the importance of work-life balance. A health scare during my time at IBM made me realize that success means nothing without wellbeing.</p>

<p>Looking at where technology is headed now, it’s clear that cybersecurity will be a major focus in the coming years. The integration of electronics, telecom, IT, and computing is creating exciting new opportunities. While AI and automation are changing how we work, human judgment will always be valuable. India has a huge opportunity in semiconductor manufacturing, a field where we currently have limited presence.</p>

<p>To young professionals starting their careers, I always say: keep things simple. Master your core subjects first. Stay updated with industry trends through webinars and events, but don’t get lost in the details. Build interest in emerging technologies like AI and quantum computing, but remember - they’re tools, not magic solutions.</p>

<p>Avoid taking on unnecessary burdens like loans early in your career. They can limit your ability to take risks and explore opportunities. Give yourself the freedom to grow and learn without financial pressure holding you back.
Despite all the professional achievements, I’ve never lost touch with what keeps me grounded. I still love playing cricket - I’ve told my team I’ll keep playing until Dhoni retires! It’s these personal connections and interests that make the journey worthwhile.</p>

<p>Looking back at my old college spots where we used to gather, things are different now. But while places change, the fundamentals of success remain the same: hard work, continuous learning, and the courage to embrace challenges when they come your way. Whether you’re from a top institute or a lesser-known college, your long-term success depends on your dedication and willingness to innovate. The technology world is always evolving, and the key is to evolve with it while staying true to yourself.</p>

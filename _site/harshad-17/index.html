  <h1>From Chaos to Success: An Engineering Student’s Unfiltered Journey (#17 Harshad Bhaiya)</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>I come from a background where my paternal and maternal side come from two contrasting worlds, with engineering on my paternal side and medicine on my maternal side.</p>

<p>Growing up, I could see two options in front of me, either becoming a doctor or an engineer, and though there was a possibility of business, it was never truly considered a reality. Of the two options before me, I was more inclined toward engineering.</p>

<p>Up until 10th, I knew I was good at maths and general studies, so I chose PCM and aimed for JEE. My parents motivated me to get into a good college and secure a placement and that was just the whole point. In my 11th standard, I found the school curriculum uninteresting, which led me to explore web development on my own. After scoring 97.4% in 12th, I was determined to pursue computer science.</p>

<p>I was born and brought up in Pune. I took admission in Allen Career Institute after 10th to advance in my JEE journey. The course was of two years and we had virtual classes, and I barely joined any classes, maybe three to four total. Once you get a series of backlogs, the class moves ahead of you, and it’s very hard catching up. My classes were always ahead of me.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="first-impressions-reality-check-at-nit">First Impressions: Reality Check at NIT</h3>

<p>I hadn’t put much thought before coming here. I came to college on November 3rd or 4th 2022 which was when the physical registration started. My result came in round one, and I kept hoping it would change in subsequent rounds. But it didn’t. Six, seven rounds yet nothing shifted.</p>

<p>After coming here, one question kept nudging me: have I come to the right place? The difference between colleges in Pune and government colleges in the North East was evident. When I went to the CSE department, it was a very eye-opening experience.</p>

<p>My physical registration started with drama. I had two caste certificates: one state and one center version. My caste certificate had inconsistent spelling issues. Because of this, I had to write an application stating that if the documents were ever found to be fabricated, I’d be removed from college. That threat lingered over me throughout my first year.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-naïve-years-learning-life-the-hard-way">The Naïve Years: Learning Life the Hard Way</h3>

<p>I was naive and immature in my first year. I think most of my development happened only after coming to college. In the beginning, I was childish and unwise, simply snowballing through my journey, living on the edge of a knife. Still, I’m happy with how it went.</p>

<p>I didn’t go to classes much. In four years, it was only in the first year I attended classes regularly, and even then my attendance was 60-70%.</p>

<p>I never chose groups with the aim of my career being benefitted. Instead, I went where I felt comfortable and genuinely wanted.</p>

<p>My ego got thrashed numerous times during these years. Many times my friends, seniors probably humiliated or humbled me. Later, when you try to develop your mindset, you realize you can be more confident. That’s when I realized the person whose ego loses, wins.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="finding-my-place-nlc-and-the-debate-scene">Finding My Place: NLC and the Debate Scene</h3>

<p>The first year was defined by two things: my hostel life and NLC. We went to fests starting with IIT Guwahati. Think about it. An eighteen year old person from Pune who never moved out suddenly goes 3000+ kilometers away and then travels everywhere.</p>

<p>The NLC meant a lot to me. I became the DebSoc lead and trained with seniors like Nancy Didi and Mouni Bhaiya. We went to Guwahati for the Asian Parliamentary debate. Three new people who barely knew each other, practiced a couple times, then went to nationals. It was a great journey.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-leadership-challenge-from-learner-to-mentor">The Leadership Challenge: From Learner to Mentor</h3>

<p>The transition to being DebSoc lead in second year was very drastic. While in the first year you’re just learning, suddenly you’re in a position of authority with a set of juniors. You’re constantly surrounded by people better than you.</p>

<p>But here’s what I learned: I’m not cut out for leadership positions. Till 10th, I was the school head boy, but I realized I had too much ego, selfishness, narcissism. I can be a reliable team member, but not the front-leading type.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="academic-disasters-the-art-of-surviving-without-studying">Academic Disasters: The Art of Surviving Without Studying</h3>

<p>Let me be honest about academics, I wasn’t into it at all. My friend Lakshay and I in CSE never crossed 20% cumulative attendance from second year onward.</p>

<p>My academic strategy was studying one night before exams. My SGPA peaked at 8.24 once, but mostly hovered around 7.5.</p>

<p>But disaster struck in sixth semester. My CGPA was 7.45, and I wanted to cross 7.5 for placement eligibility. Instead, I got P grades in both lab and theory of the same subject, tanking my SGPA to 6.24.</p>

<p>After getting placed, I gave sweets to the same sir who gave me P grades. Both faculty members laughed: “Corporate life is different. You need discipline, structure.”</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-placement-miracle-how-everything-changed">The Placement Miracle: How Everything Changed</h3>

<p>For PhonePe placement, I contacted seniors immediately: “Tell me everything. I want to get placed here.”</p>

<p>My preparation focused on SQL, Excel, estimation problems, puzzles, and case studies. Some lucky overlaps from NIT Warangal’s drive helped me crack the OA.</p>

<p>The interviews had three rounds:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Technical</strong> (SQL queries, designing customer support architecture)</li>
  <li><strong>HR-focused</strong> (conflict over WhatsApp bot usage)</li>
  <li><strong>Final Round</strong> (balancing AI chatbots with human agents)</li>
</ul>

<p>Getting selected was incredible. I was crying and laughing simultaneously. Nobody expected it from someone not studious.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="people-who-shaped-me">People Who Shaped Me</h3>

<p>Throughout college, I’ve been a people’s person, adapting to any circle easily. Hostel life was crucial since I barely attended classes.</p>

<p>Two friends were particularly important: Sharmitha and Manasa. While hostel mates taught me about life, these two kept me connected with academics.</p>

<p>I looked up to people like Rik for debating skills and Sadhvi Didi for compassionate strength.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="my-projects-and-passion">My Projects and Passion</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Allen Digital Website</strong> – frontend project from 11th</li>
  <li><strong>Car Price Prediction</strong> – ML project using Python</li>
  <li><strong>Code-Off</strong> – my passion project, a 1v1 coding battle platform</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-harsh-reality-industry-changes">The Harsh Reality: Industry Changes</h3>

<p>Placements have deteriorated drastically. From 18.65 LPA average to 11 LPA, and dropping further.</p>

<p>The new trend is <strong>quant engineering</strong>, but opportunities are rare and mostly for IIT graduates.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="what-needs-to-change-at-nit-agartala">What Needs to Change at NIT Agartala</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Bureaucratic administration must improve</li>
  <li>Drug culture needs eradication</li>
  <li>Coding culture must be revived</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="final-reflections">Final Reflections</h3>

<p>If the three batches behind me remember me, I’ll be happy. I want to be remembered as someone with 7 CGPA who didn’t attend classes but still made it through.</p>

<p>My advice: <strong>do whatever you want. Don’t listen to others. Avoid harmful things, work toward your goal, and don’t waste any day of your life.</strong></p>

<p>Because at the end of the day, this chaotic journey taught me that sometimes the most unconventional paths lead to meaningful destinations.</p>

  <h1>Palakkad to NIT Agartala (#1 Raheena Bin Mohammed)</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>The Tripura humidity clung to me like a second skin as I wrestled my suitcase into the hostel room allotted to me.  It struck me that I had already left behind the tidy, simple life I’d had in Palakkad. College was my escape pod. NIT felt like a daring leap.</p>

<p>Chemical Engineering was definitely the main draw. I’d devoured every textbook I could find on polymers and catalysis and waste management - yearning to translate theory into something tangible. But the real thrill was the prospect of being surrounded by India, not the sanitized version I knew from travel brochures and other media depictions.  Here, in this remote corner - amongst the Seven Sisters states, I craved the chaos, the unfamiliarity, the tremendous opportunities hanging in the air.</p>

<p>In these 4 years, this shoebox of a room would be my launchpad. This wasn’t home, and that was okay. I was a blank slate, ready to be etched with the stories of a thousand strangers, and a million experiences. College wasn’t just about beakers and chemical formulas anymore; it was about stepping out of the shadows and into the vibrance of India, one roommate, one shared meal, one late-night conversation at a time.</p>

<p>So, I signed up for the NCC. Drilling under the unforgiving Tripura sun was a baptism by fire. The NCC helped me learn discipline, pushed me to take on a sense of responsibility, forge new friendships, and made me feel like I belonged. Later, a debate competition catapulted me into the NITA Literary Club. Surrounded by poets and polemicists, I discovered my knack for putting words together into arguments that resonated. My life here also got tinged with theatrics. Aaveg’s infectious energy was impossible to resist. There, under the harsh stage lights, I learned the power of expression that transcended words. I also served as part of the mess committee in college for two whole years - trying my best to take steps to uphold the quality of the food being served. Alongside all of these activities, I also found myself part of the Handball team, hurtling down the court alongside six other incredibly dedicated sportswomen. It was a remarkably rewarding experience.</p>

<p>Then came the nominations for the Gymkhana - the student government body. Winning the Vice President position felt surreal. However, let me emphasize. For me, the post wasn’t ever about power. I only ever wanted to learn, to have enriching experiences, to upskill. Being part of so many activities gave me the push outside my comfort zone that I had always craved - unveiling potential I never knew I possessed. One of the greatest highlights of my journey here in college has been getting invited on an enriching journey at the Rashtrapati Bhavan to witness the magic of ‘Vividhta ka Amrit Mahotsav: A cultural odyssey celebrating the tapestry of Northeast’. The event beautifully united the traditional arts, crafts, and diverse cultures of the Northeast under one vibrant umbrella. Getting nominated by the institute made me feel extremely honored and grateful for the opportunity.</p>

<p>However, none of this was ever about titles; it was about the indelible marks these experiences were etching on my soul. College, I was realizing, wasn’t just about textbooks and exams. It was a kaleidoscope of experiences, each a fragment that chipped away at the sheltered girl from Palakkad. With every debate, every performance, every desperate lunge for the handball, I was a little more the woman I was meant to be.</p>

<p>The whirlwind of college life continued to spin. Each new experience, from the camaraderie of the NCC to the electrifying buzz of debate victories, hammered home a crucial lesson: the importance of people and relationships. Surrounded by passionate individuals, I was learning empathy, understanding, and the beautiful messiness of human connection. These connections, I realized, were the invisible threads, creating my life for me. To everyone reading - I believe success is a double-edged sword. The elation of being elected Vice President was beautiful. However, I learned to keep a level head and never let the joy of success turn into pride. Humility is key or one begins to stagnate or even worse - fall away in life. Let the thrill of achievement fuel you but never let it eclipse the joy of the journey.  Every failure is a chance to learn, strategize, and come back stronger.</p>

<p>Amongst the constant stress of keeping up with life and the curveballs it throws at you, it is easy to forget to be kind. It is important to remind ourselves then, that kindness isn’t just a nicety; it is the bedrock of genuine connection. A shared smile with a shy batchmate in the library, a helping hand to a struggling teammate – these seemingly small acts ripple outwards, creating a more positive, supportive environment.</p>

<p>On career and the constant academic stress, I feel that one shouldn’t merely get into a rat race about coding or any field simply because everyone else is doing it. You should rather try to search and find your passion because that way you’ll find something meaningful that you can do for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>The recognition that followed some of my achievements was a pleasant surprise, but the true reward was the sense of community, the knowledge that I was part of something bigger than myself.</p>

<p>To the batches of students that are here currently and will come to this college after I have left, i would like to emphasize the importance of unity and responsibility. This college is a microcosm of India, a place where vibrant cultures and traditions converge. I would like to implore the students to celebrate their diversity but to remember that these differences should enrich their lives and experiences - not divide them.</p>

<p>And a lot of times, the things we take for rights aren’t actually rights. They’re privileges. The freedoms students enjoy come with a responsibility to themselves, their peers, and the institution. We should realize the importance of being responsible students who respect rules, contribute to the community, and understand that with every right comes accountability to the greater good.</p>

<p>These 4 beautiful years here, slowly transformed the girl who came to this college craving the unfamiliar. I now find myself with a heart brimming with a newfound appreciation for people, for the delicate balance of success and failure, and for the simple joy of doing things because they matter, and not because they garner applause.</p>

  <h1>From Shadows to Starlight (#9 Gaurav Shrivastav)</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>I grew up in Bettiah, a small town in West Champaran, Bihar.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88b62125-d2e8-437c-8b74-09d9c7872d2f" alt="28d9e7c4-0535-46b1-9812-770d73f04114" /></p>

<p>During my childhood, I studied at Saraswati Shishu Vidya Mandir School, a Hindi-medium institution where I completed my primary education. My father, who worked for someone else at the time, understood the importance of English and decided to transfer me to an English Medium school. This transition happened in the fifth grade, when I joined St. Michael’s High School after passing an entrance exam.</p>

<p>Completing my 10th grade was no easy feat. My batch was for the 2017-2018 board exams, and by December 2017, I had completed my 
syllabus. However, on the first of January, my father experienced severe stomach pain and was diagnosed with appendicitis. He underwent surgery and was advised complete bed rest. My father was a businessman, running a spare parts business, so his inability to work left our family in a difficult situation. Being the eldest, I took on the responsibility of managing the business, which meant traveling 100 kilometers daily to sell spare parts. Despite these challenges, I managed to score 450 out of 500 in my board exams. It was a proud 
moment for my family.</p>

<p>Initially, I didn’t dream of becoming an engineer. My aspiration was to join the defence forces, inspired by relatives and friends in the army 
and the navy. I was part of a group that ran every morning, and engineering wasn’t even on my mind. However, one of my coaching teachers noticed my academic potential and suggested to my parents that I pursue further studies. The idea of preparing for the JEE exams came up, and my father, hearing about Kota’s reputation, decided to send me there.</p>

<p>In Kota, I joined Resonance and paid the initial fee of ₹73,000. However, I attended few classes before realizing how lonely I felt being away from home. I called my mother, and she supported my decision to return home. Back in Patna, I focused on preparing for my 
12th exams and enrolled in separate coaching centers for Maths, Physics, and Chemistry. Unfortunately, these centers primarily catered to NEET aspirants, and the JEE preparation was subpar.</p>

<p>By the end of class 11, I realized how far behind I was when I couldn’t solve a single JEE question paper.In January 2020, I joined a new coaching center in Patna despite being 
late in the session. I dedicated myself to preparing for JEE Mains. My class 12 board exams went well, and I scored 445 out of 500. But then, the pandemic hit, and everything went online. With my notes and books left behind in Patna, adapting to online classes was a struggle. Despite this, I managed to score 76 percentile in my first JEE Mains attempt and 78 percentile in the second. Although I qualified for JEE Advanced, my performance there wasn’t strong enough to secure a good rank.</p>

<p>Facing uncertainty about my future, I decided to prepare for JEE Mains again. On October 8, I enrolled in Motion Institute’s online classes from Kota. I rented a room 50 kilometers away to minimize distractions and dedicated myself to studying for 12 hours a day. The new policy allowed four JEE Mains attempts, and I gradually improved, scoring 97 percentile in my second attempt. This qualified me for JEE Advanced, but my rank wasn’t high enough for an IIT. Through JOSAA counseling, I secured admission to NIT Agartala for Electronics and Communication Engineering.</p>

<p>Arriving at NIT Agartala marked a turning point in my life. Initially, I didn’t pay much attention to my branch, but when I achieved a 9.41 CGPA in my first semester, I realized I could aim for a branch change. I studied diligently in my second semester, scoring a 9.61 SGPA, which brought my overall CGPA to 9.5. By God’s grace, I successfully transferred to Computer Science Engineering.</p>

<p>From the third semester onward, I began exploring college life. However, I became less focused on academics and more absorbed in campus activities. In the fourth semester, I scored just 5 out of 20 in a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) test, prompting a stern warning from our professor, Suman Deb Sir. His advice pushed me to seek help and refocus on my studies. Over 10-12 days, I completed studying stacks and queues and began competitive programming on platforms like Codeforces and LeetCode.</p>

<p>In my fifth semester, internship season began. The first company to visit was Piramal Housing and Finance, offering a role in software testing. Though initially uninterested, I completed their assignment, solved graph-related problems, and cleared the interview. On September 1, I was selected for an internship. Although I was happy, I had mixed feelings about the package that was offered. After discussing with seniors, I shifted my focus back to academics.</p>

<p>I interned in Bangalore during the summer and returned to college for placement season. My initial interviews with companies like Cloud Era and EPam didn’t go as planned. My dream was to join Oracle, and after clearing their assessment and three interview rounds, I was thrilled to be selected.</p>

<p>My brother Saurav, who is diligently preparing for the Bihar Civil Services Commission, is truly remarkable. I deeply admire his determination and the passion he brings to his goals. We not only share a strong bond, but we also inspire each other with our dreams and ambitions. It’s a privilege to be on this journey together, supporting one another along the way.</p>

<p>Academically, following teachers’ guidance is often enough. The support of mentors and seniors was invaluable to me. Abhijeet Yadav, a senior, helped me significantly during my second year, offering advice and support whenever I needed it. Even now, we stay in touch weekly. Another close friend, Anuj Sahi, has been a great guide and inspiration.</p>

<p>College life also brought me valuable friendships. Chaitanya, a batchmate, became a pivotal figure in my journey. When we first met, I struggled with my English and found it difficult to hold conversations. Chaitanya offered to help, and over time, I improved significantly. Together, we created a Personality Development Group to help juniors improve their communication skills. Meeting every weekend with juniors like Swati and Aaradhya, we practiced and supported each other.</p>

<p>Looking back on my college journey, I’ve realized just how important it is to choose your friends carefully. A great group of friends can make your experience unforgettable, while a not-so-great one might leave you with some regrets. I feel so grateful for my friends—Rajeev, Sachin, Nand, Zamiul, and Devanshu. They’ve truly been my anchors throughout this adventure, always there for me through thick and thin. Sachin stands out, as he was one of the first friends I made once in-person classes started up again. We have had such a great time studying together and figuring out our paths!</p>

<p>NIT Agartala also allowed me to experience a new culture and traditions. Initially, the college lacked active clubs, but over time, facilities and opportunities improved. I found a balance here that friends in other NITs envied, as they often faced stricter academic pressures.</p>

<p>I’ll always cherish the memories of my time here — the trips, the friendships, and even trying chicken kasa at Gargi Amul, which became my favorite food. College is a remarkable opportunity to embark on a journey of self-exploration. Embrace activities, uncover new interests, and pursue your passions freely and joyfully. To anyone reading this, I encourage you to embrace the journey. Explore, learn, and build lasting memories. College is a unique chapter in life, and it’s up to you to make the most of it.</p>

<p>As I look ahead, I envision myself in a reputable organization, contributing meaningfully while guiding others. Personally, I hope to maintain good health and continue growing.</p>

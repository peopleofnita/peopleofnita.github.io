*People of NITA* is a community for the students of [NIT Agartala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Technology_Agartala). <br> <br>
Our main aim with this project is to document the uncaptured stories of the people that set their feet in this college. <br> <br>
We believe that everyone has a story to tell. We want to build a home for these stories and hopefully build a sense of belonging through this community.<br> <br>
 We want to be a river for the hundreds of boats that are peoples' stories. Allow us to be a medium for the story that you've always wanted to put out before the world but couldn't.

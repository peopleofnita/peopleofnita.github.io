title: Onwards And Upwards (#5 Devanshu Deo)
---

Growing up, I was always fascinated by the respect and admiration that my neighbour's son, an IIT graduate received in our community. This inspired me to pursue engineering and make a similar impact on society.


Initially, I planned to follow the conventional path of preparing for JEE in Kota after 11th and 12th grade. I had never been too studious but always secured decent marks in exams thats why was never too bothered about my studies in school. With the support of two of my close friends, who encouraged me to fill out forms for various olympiads, institutes, and even the Super 30 program, I started taking my studies a bit more seriously. I focused primarily on physics, maths and chemistry, subjects crucial for JEE. When I cleared the first two rounds of the Super 30 selection process and was called for an interview, I faced a dilemma. I wasn’t confident in the abilities of a free program to get me Computer Science in an IIT which had been my dream for as long as I could remember and so even though our family was going through a bit of a financial crunch during the time, I convinced my parents to let me go to Kota and they supported me with everything that they had.
In Kota, I cut off all distractions, including my social connections, and dedicated myself entirely to studies. I put in more effort than I ever had before, working harder than I had during my entire childhood up to 10th grade. Initially, I performed well in Kota and scored good ranks in the institute tests to maintain my batch of A1 in 11th. However, as I entered 12th grade, my health deteriorated due to sinus and asthma problems aggravated by the pollution and dust in Kota, to which I was allergic. This significantly impacted my studies, causing me to miss my classes.
When I returned home for a month-long break, my health worsened further, and my family advised me to postpone my return to Kota. This further disrupted my studies, leaving me feeling lost and unable to cope up with the fast-paced teaching in Kota, where missing even a single day's class could leave you behind.

In Kota, I faced numerous challenges, including my deteriorating health and the fast-paced teaching environment. Despite my best efforts, I was unable to keep up with the top batch and felt discouraged.
One day, a teacher who taught organic chemistry noticed my distress. He encouraged me to believe in myself and reminded me that I had the potential to succeed in IIT. Inspired by his words, I decided to change my approach and join the repeaters batch, where I could cover the concepts of that I had missed in class 12th
However, my progress was again hindered after 3 months when I contracted chickenpox and had to return home for 10-15 days. Upon returning to Kota, I found myself further struggling to cope with the academic workload. My confidence in my abilities waned, and I started neglecting my studies. Feeling lost and disillusioned, I turned to video games, and social media for distraction- becoming a pro player in Pubg . As the JEE Mains exam approached, I injured my toe while playing football, forcing me to lose my first JEE attempt. This disruption further affected my preparation. Amidst the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic, I managed to give my second JEE attempt, but my performance was far from satisfactory. I knew that I hadn’t studied to the best of my capabilities this time. So, I decided to give JEE another try and then took a drop. We had 4 attempts this time. My first attempt got wasted again. But I decided I’d go to Kota again and give the rest of my attempts with utmost sincerity. The second attempt got impacted by the 2nd wave of COVID-19.
Then, the education minister announced a series of changes to the JEE Mains exam schedule, announcing that the last two attempts would take place in consecutive weeks and JEE Advanced would be held just two weeks after the last JEE Mains attempt. This news came as a devastating blow, as I felt I had already wasted too much time and effort to catch up.
Dejected and defeated, I sank into a state of depression. I felt paralysed, unable to think or act. My mother, understanding my despair, stayed with me in Kota, providing unwavering support and encouragement. With her help, I gradually emerged from my emotional turmoil and decided to give one last attempt at JEE Mains. Despite my lacklustre preparation, I managed to secure a rank that earned me admission into NIT Agartala.
After considering the campuses, I chose NIT Agartala, drawn by its greenery and peaceful environment. I enrolled in the chemical engineering program, hoping to find a sense of purpose and direction in my life.
My journey to NIT Agartala was marked by numerous setbacks and challenges, but I persevered through them all, learning valuable lessons about resilience, determination, and the importance of seeking support when needed. Despite the disappointments and struggles, I am grateful for the experiences that have shaped me into the person I am today.

When I first arrived at college, the initial few months were online due to the pandemic. During that time, I connected with a few guys and girls who were from Bihar and Tripura in my section. One of them, Rajeev, who is now one of my closest friends, decided to take an initiative. He contacted all the students from Bihar, including me, and formed a group that also included a few students from Rajasthan and UP. Rajeev's focus at the time was on improving everyone's English speaking skills, considering it an essential skill for engineers.
The group didn't quite achieve its intended purpose of improving English, but it did forge strong bonds between us. This was a very useful group when college was completely online.
Once online classes ended and we physically came to college, I was decently happy with my SGPA of 9.0. While it wasn't bad, seeing some people with much higher scores who were also aiming for branch changes made me realise I wouldn’t be able to slide my branch . So, I decided to work upon my skills and started participating in various club events. I joined NCC for the sense of unity and discipline and took part in debate competitions which were conducted by Nita Literary Club and won them. After that i worked as a core member and conducted events in NLC. Coming to college was a wake-up call. Unlike school, where I neglected studies in favour of random activities and events, I realised I needed to focus on academics and make something of myself.
Now, in the first year, we hadn’t gotten our fresher’s party. Thankfully, my friend Rajeev came to the rescue again. Since there weren't any official fresher's events planned for the first years, he proposed that we organise it ourselves. We spent a lot of time planning and coordinating everything. We managed to collect a significant sum of money (around 1.5 lakhs) from all the first-year students, boys and girls, across every section. We connected with each and every student of our year. For a first-time event, it was a huge accomplishment.
However, at the last minute, we faced a major hurdle. The acting director, who was in charge while the main director was away, refused to grant us permissions. Even though we had obtained permission from the Dean of Student Welfare, this director's disapproval meant the event couldn't proceed.
This situation was frustrating, but it also became a valuable learning experience. We had successfully coordinated everything, brought together students from different states, and planned meticulously. Even though the event fell through, we managed to return every penny we had collected to each student.
This experience taught me the importance of trust. Despite the setback, we delivered on our promise, which built trust among the students. Since there weren't any seniors in the college at the time, we relied solely on ourselves for this entire initiative. This first year in college was a turning point for me in many ways.

When I started my second year, I was called upon by the seniors to participate in the Ganesh Puja, an annual event organised by second-year students. Since I had already gained some recognition through my participation in debates and other activities, the seniors considered me an obvious choice to carry the event’s responsibilities.
We worked together to plan and execute the Ganesh Puja, and it went smoothly despite some minor hiccups. However, the night after the puja took a dark turn. A violent clash erupted between students, resulting in injuries, property damage, and national headlines. This incident was a major setback for us, as it shattered our perception of the college as a peaceful and studious environment. We witnessed the consequences of administrative action and the negative impact of such conflicts on the college community.
After this setback, I decided to focus on my academics and branch-related activities. I also started learning coding, realising its importance in the job market. As I progressed through my second year, I discovered that the companies that I had been expecting to get interviewed by and placed in were not interested in hiring students from our branch. This realisation, coupled with the ongoing recession, made me question the relevance of my chosen path of coding.
I shifted my focus to analytics, a field that was in demand, and dropped my coding skills. Around the same time, I was approached by seniors from an organisation called Think India, which worked on various initiatives within the college. They persisted, and eventually, I agreed to join Think India. I was hesitant at first, but I gradually became more involved in their activities.
Because of the seniors that I came into contact with through Think India, one of the first things I worked on was organising a fresher's event for our immediate juniors. We were determined to make it a memorable experience for the new students, and we put in a lot of effort to plan and execute it flawlessly. The event was a resounding success, and it was the most well-organised and well-attended event I have ever witnessed during my college life. We received positive feedback from everyone, and I was proud of our team's accomplishments. After the success of the fresher's event, we celebrated with a bike trip to dumboor lake. It was a great way to bond with my teammates and create lasting memories. I also put my hands in drama and acting to explore this area with a drama competition in Hindi Saptah where I secured 2nd position and  afterwards acted in a short-film as a lead character. Along with these I was appointed the Event Management & Creative Head for NLC club which lead to development of my leadership and management skills. I also did a NCC camp of one week which was challenging but got to learn many things and my bonds with NCC seniors and batchmates got stronger .At the end of me 2nd year I was given the position of Campus Convener of Think India NIT Agartala and conducted various events through it to raise cultural awareness and propel a “nation first” attitude among the students. Finally at the end of 2nd year, I cleared the NCC B certificate examination.
I continued to be involved in Think India throughout my third year, organising various events and initiatives. I became heavily involved in organising events throughout college. My work with Think India even earned me recognition at the national level, and I was eventually appointed as the state convener for Tripura. I learned valuable leadership and organisational skills, and I gained a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing students in my college. My experiences in Think India have played a significant role in my personal and professional development. I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of such a meaningful organisation.

One of the most impactful projects I worked on was a Personality Development Program for Bihar students: PDB. We recognised that many students from Bihar lacked confidence in their communication skills, especially when it came to speaking English. This often held them back from participating in events and expressing themselves freely. To address this issue, we started PDB, a program designed to help Bihar students improve their English speaking and overall communication skills. Chaitanya, a friend from our section, played a key role in developing the program. He had a deep understanding of communication skills and was passionate about helping others develop their confidence.
Before officially launching PDB, we had a small group in our hostel with Chaitanya, Gaurav, Sachin, and Rajeev. We conducted regular English speaking sessions for ourselves, and we quickly noticed significant improvements in our own communication skills. This motivated us to move forward with PDB.
We invited junior students from Bihar to participate in PDB, providing them with intensive training in English speaking and communication skills. We conducted sessions in the college auditorium, giving our trainees a chance to practise in a public setting.
While my involvement in PDB has decreased due to my academic commitments and my role as an Internship Coordinator of my branch, the program continues to thrive under the leadership members. I am proud of the impact PDB has had on the lives of so many Bihar students, helping them overcome their communication barriers and gain confidence in their abilities.

While I wasn't very active with my juniors initially, I've had the opportunity to connect them closely in my third year. I've noticed a trend among a few students of NIT Agartala that I find concerning: a lack of dedication and commitment to the college community. While many of them are enthusiastic and eager to participate in events and clubs, others seem more focused on personal gain. They seem to view their involvement in college activities as a means to an end, rather than an opportunity to contribute to the college community and grow as individuals. This selfishness, I believe, is detrimental to the overall well-being of the college. It stifles collaboration, hinders innovation, and creates a sense of apathy among students.
I contrast this with my own experiences. Despite not having initially had any grand ambitions for my college career, I found myself drawn to opportunities that allowed me to connect with others, contribute to the college community, and develop my skills.
I became involved in Think India and I even served as the internship coordinator for my class. These experiences not only enriched my college life but also helped me grow as a leader and communicator. I believe that a sense of dedication and commitment to the college community is essential for the success of any institution. When students are invested in their college, they are more likely to participate in extracurricular activities, contribute to positive change, and ultimately, achieve their full potential.
I hope that my juniors will recognise the importance of giving back to their college and embrace opportunities to make a positive impact. By working together and fostering a spirit of collaboration, we can create a more vibrant and successful college community.

During my first year, I was particularly connected with Anuradha ma’am. She was incredibly helpful in guiding us through the process of organising events and getting involved in college life. In my second year, I found it more challenging to connect with professors on a personal level. However, my HOD sir is worth mentioning. While he may be strict and demanding, he genuinely cares about the well-being of his students and the success of our branch.
He takes the time to learn about each student's interests and activities, and he is always eager to offer guidance and support. He is actively involved in branch affairs and is always looking for ways to improve our learning experience. I appreciate his dedication to our branch and his commitment to our success. While he may not always be the easiest professor to work with, I know that he has our best interests at heart. He is a true example of what a faculty member should be: passionate about their subject matter, invested in their students' success, and committed to the overall well-being of the college community.

During my first year of college, I was determined to focus on my studies and avoid any distractions, especially relationships. However, things took an unexpected turn when I met Jui, a girl from Agartala.
Initially, I wasn't looking for a serious relationship, but our connection was undeniable. We spent countless hours exploring the campus, sharing our thoughts and dreams, and developing a deep bond. Before I knew it, I found myself falling for Jui. Her kindness, positivity, and unwavering support were like a breath of fresh air in my hectic college life. She encouraged me to pursue my passions, believed in my abilities, and always had my back, even during my darkest moments.
Our relationship blossomed, and we quickly became inseparable. We shared classes, studied together, and spent our free time exploring places and discovering new experiences.
Jui's presence in my life brought a sense of calm and stability that I had never experienced before. She is my confidante, my cheerleader, and my rock. With her by my side, I felt like I could conquer anything. I am incredibly grateful for Jui's love and support. She has made my college experience even more meaningful and has helped me grow into the person I am today. I know that our relationship is something special, and I cherish every moment we spend together.

My experiences at NIT have opened my eyes to the diversity and resilience of India's student population. Coming from a town in Bihar, I was initially apprehensive about interacting with students from different backgrounds and socioeconomic strata. However, I quickly realised that the common thread that binds us all is our shared pursuit of education and our aspiration to contribute to the betterment of our country. These students are driven by a strong desire to make the most of their opportunities and prove their worth. They come from diverse backgrounds, often facing financial hardship or social stigma, yet they persevere with unwavering determination.Their stories inspire me, reminding me that education is not a privilege but a fundamental right that should be accessible to all. The NIT system, despite its imperfections, provides a platform for these students to break the cycle of poverty and inequality and contribute to the nation's progress.
I am committed to using my own experiences and insights to advocate for greater access to quality education for students from marginalised communities. I believe that by empowering these individuals, we can unlock India's true potential and build a more equitable and prosperous society.
We should also be reaching out to students in remote areas, particularly in the state of Tripura, and inform them about the opportunities available at NIT and other institutions of higher learning because most home state students that I meet here are from Agartala but Tripura is beyond Agartala.

My journey through school and college has been a process of self-discovery, particularly in understanding my introverted nature and how it relates to my leadership aspirations. During my school days, I found myself forcing myself to be extroverted, fitting in with the social expectations of my peers. While I enjoyed connecting with others, I felt a deep sense of being an introvert at heart. I craved solitude and time for introspection, something that was often difficult to find in the bustling school environment.
Entering college brought about a shift in my perspective. I realised the importance of building genuine connections, not just for the sake of fitting in but for the mutual support and growth that comes from meaningful relationships. While I still maintained my introverted tendencies, I made an effort to step out of my comfort zone and engage with my peers, both seniors and classmates.
This newfound openness led to unexpected benefits. I discovered that my introverted nature allowed me to observe and listen attentively, gaining valuable insights into the people around me. I learned to appreciate the stories and perspectives of others, which in turn helped me develop a more empathetic and effective leadership style.
However, my journey was not without its challenges. I faced moments of doubt and uncertainty, questioning my ability to lead effectively as an introvert. I made mistakes, misjudged people, and faced criticism for my actions. But through these experiences, I learned to trust my instincts and embrace my authentic self. I realised that true leadership is not about projecting an extroverted persona or conforming to societal expectations. It's about understanding others, inspiring them, and empowering them to reach their full potential. It's about leading with integrity, authenticity, and a genuine desire to make a positive impact.
I am still on this journey of self-discovery and leadership development, but I am confident that my introverted nature is not a limitation but a strength. It allows me to connect with people on a deeper level, listen with empathy, and lead with authenticity. I am committed to using my introverted strengths to make a positive difference in the world.

As I look back on my life, I realise that I've made my share of mistakes and faced my fair share of challenges. There have been moments when I've felt overwhelmed, tempted to give up, and questioning my abilities. But despite these setbacks, I've learned to persevere, to draw strength from my experiences, and to continue moving forward.
I'm grateful for the unwavering support I've received from my family and friends.From the day I left home for Kota to pursue my education, they have been my pillars of strength, offering encouragement and guidance every step of the way. Their unwavering belief in me has given me the confidence to face my fears and overcome obstacles. They've taught me the importance of hard work, resilience, and the power of positive thinking.
I know that I'm not perfect, and that there will be more challenges ahead. But I'm determined to learn from my mistakes, to embrace my imperfections, and to continue striving for my goals. I'm also grateful for the love and support of my mother and my girlfriend, who have been my biggest cheerleaders. Their presence in my life has brought me immense joy and strength.
I'm at a stage in my life where I'm grateful for the opportunities that have come my way, for the lessons I've learned, and for the people who have supported me along the way. Everything is going well, and I'm facing each challenge with renewed determination. I know that problems are an inevitable part of life, and I'm learning to embrace them as opportunities for growth.
I've always been fascinated by characters who embody the qualities of integrity, resilience, and a willingness to stand up for what's right, even in the face of adversity. One such character is Ned Stark from the Game of Thrones series. Ned Stark, the Hand of the King, was a man of honor and principle. He believed in doing what was right, even when it meant making difficult choices or going against the grain. Despite his unwavering commitment to justice, he faced numerous challenges and ultimately met a tragic end. Ned's story resonates with me because it highlights the importance of staying true to one's values, even when it's difficult or unpopular. He faced betrayal, loss, and even death, but he never wavered in his belief in doing what was right. His unwavering commitment to his principles, even in the face of immense personal sacrifice, is a powerful reminder that integrity and moral courage are essential qualities for any leader. While Ned's story is fictional, it offers valuable lessons that can be applied to our own lives. It reminds us that it's important to stand up for what we believe in, even when it's difficult, and that doing the right thing often comes at a cost. I believe that Ned Stark's story is a powerful reminder of the importance of integrity, resilience, and moral courage. It's a story that has inspired me and many others, and I'm sure it will continue to do so for generations to come.
I'm excited to continue learning and growing, and to share my experiences with others. I believe that together, we can make a difference in the world. I'm excited about the future and the possibilities that lie ahead. I'm eager to connect with new people, build meaningful relationships, and make a positive impact on the world. My family, friends, and loved ones have always been my source of inspiration, and I'm committed to making them proud. I'm determined to make the most of my life and to leave a legacy of kindness and compassion.
This is my story.

title:  My Engineering Odyssey (#4 Jameel Jamhar)
---

I'm currently in my fourth year, pursuing a bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering. Although I was born in India, in the hill station of Wayanad, Kerala, I spent a significant part of my life, almost half, in Saudi Arabia.

That's where most of my childhood memories and formative experiences lie. The person you see before you today is largely shaped by my time in Saudi Arabia. My focus was on excelling in school, and after graduating, I faced a choice between Science and Commerce. Even though my dad was an accountant, and my mom too worked in accounts, with a family steeped in the field, there wasn't a strong push on my brother and me towards becoming accountants ourselves. In fact, it was my mom who nudged us in the direction of science degrees, even though we didn't have a burning aspiration for it at the time. We were just going with the flow.

We opted for the science stream, taking Physics, Chemistry, and Math, with Biology being a definite no-go. So, it was a significant transition to move back to India from such a different environment. The gradual change from a laid-back Saudi Arabian lifestyle to a more intense one in India was a big adjustment. Just as an example, there was a stark difference in the school system and the overall student life, including classroom interactions – everything felt new.

Starting away from home, especially during 11th and 12th grade, was a challenging phase, honestly. The first four or five months were particularly difficult for me and my twin brother. We grappled with emotions and a completely new way of life. It was a demanding environment – coaching classes were a whole new game for us. We weren't used to the pressure of academics and the competitive nature of entrance exams.

Frankly, my motivation to study initially came from the difficult situation we were in. My dad was investing a lot in this coaching, and my brother wasn't doing as well. So, I came to the conclusion that ultimately, one of us had to focus on our studies. It wasn't that I wasn't interested in studying, but I wasn't particularly passionate about any specific subject either. However, after 11th grade, things started to click. I grasped the importance of competition and entrance exams. I performed well in school, securing good marks and a decent rank.

While I wasn't particularly drawn to engineering, I found myself gravitating towards Chemistry. I was aware of the vast difference between pure chemistry and chemical engineering, but the principles of chemistry genuinely fascinated me. Initially, I considered Production Engineering, and I even secured a seat at NIT Calicut. But at that point, I craved a new experience. I wanted to challenge myself in a new environment and immerse myself in a different culture.

Coming from Saudi Arabia, even though we studied Indian history, the Eastern part of India remained largely unexplored territory for me. The idea of venturing to a completely different part of the world was very appealing. Compared to the Eastern regions, Kerala, where I hail from, has a more established infrastructure. So, exploring a new region felt more exciting.

Ultimately, choosing NIT Agartala was a bold decision. While my parents were supportive, there were also concerns. However, I went with my gut feeling, and looking back, it's been one of the best decisions I've made. The first two years, however, coincided with the pandemic. While I won't dwell on online classes, for me personally, it wasn't as challenging. It offered a more relaxed pace, with less pressure to attend classes physically. Exams became easier to manage, and good grades were more attainable. It wasn't the same kind of academic battle I was anticipating.

In my first year, I realized I preferred Chemistry. My grades were good that year, which made it easier to switch to Chemical Engineering since most students aiming to transfer focused on Computer Science. I managed to successfully transition into Chemical Engineering during my first year.

The second year was where the real challenge began, but it was also an interesting experience. Unlike the third semester, where dynamics wasn't a major focus, the focus shifted in the fourth semester. In my first year, I hadn't interacted much with anyone. I only connected with one person, Lokesh, a Mumbai guy with whom I'd do assignments and study for exams. It wasn't that I was introverted; I was more on the lazy side during the pandemic period. Subjects like waste management didn't hold my interest, and I preferred in-person interactions. I'd always been someone who thrived on physical connections, and Lokesh was the only friend I had made outside of Kerala.

After switching to Chemical Engineering, I looked for classmates from Kerala but ended up meeting others. I gradually made more friends, around three to four, but not more than ten. Our conversations mainly revolved around academics. This social dynamic continued through the fourth semester. Just after our midterms, we arrived here in August. The reality was quite different from my expectations. While I had some basic expectations of the people I'd meet, everything turned out to be completely unexpected. The place had a very diverse population, including tribal communities, which surprised me. The first few days of classes were interesting. Before classes started, we had four days for orientation activities. This was the first chance to meet everyone in our batch. I met Vinay, who became my roommate, and later Advaith and Janish. We formed a close circle, which meant a lot to me.

The first day of class was a bit unusual. It was like seeing people you'd interacted with on WhatsApp for the first time in real life. While I mentioned I'm not particularly introverted, I wasn't sure how to approach people because many had already formed friendships. Especially the Bengali and North Indian students, they assumed a South Indian guy like me wouldn't know Hindi. They'd help me translate when seniors or teachers spoke to us. Even though I understood Hindi, I played along a bit. This actually made it easier to connect with some of the girls, especially Ananta, who became one of my closest friends throughout college.

The first semester flew by. Just before the fifth semester, although I wanted to intern, I didn't have a clear direction for my future career aspirations. I was unsure what field I wanted to pursue after my bachelor's degree. I tried to immerse myself in subjects like process control and chemical reaction engineering, but that wasn't the best approach. Realizing this by the end of my second year, I decided to pursue a research internship to gain practical experience in Chemical Engineering. Since the pandemic limited options, I shortlisted around 100 professors across various chemical engineering departments at IIT’s and NIT’s. While I wasn't particularly passionate about research at the time, and I didn't have extensive experience or a strong portfolio with internships or projects – just some basic undergraduate assignments – I decided to take action. Every day, I emailed random professors, highlighting my interest in research and potential industry collaborations. It wasn't the most conventional approach, but with the pandemic limiting options, it was the best I could do with a limited resume.

The process involved a lot of persistence. Unlike some cultures where professors might reject you outright, in India, you often need to follow up. It took two months of consistent emailing and reminders. Finally, my efforts paid off. Through this unconventional strategy, I secured five internship opportunities among the top IIT’s, all focused on different research topics.

Before my second year ended, I chose a research internship on hydrogen energy at IIT Ropar (one of the five offers) because of its remote nature. While it might seem like the lazier option, it allowed me to return home to Saudi Arabia for those two months. However, that internship truly transformed my perspective.

Those two months completely changed my life in terms of direction and passion. The internship exposed me to a completely new area of chemical engineering. I thrived in the project and connected well with the professor and my supervisor. For the first time, I genuinely enjoyed what I was doing in the field of chemical engineering. It ignited a real interest for me.

Back in my third year, considered the most crucial year due to the foundational subjects covered, I decided to focus on this newfound area. Right after the internship, my professor encouraged me to submit a research paper to IIT Roorkee. The paper I was part of  won the best paper award! Shortly after, in September, I co-authored another conference paper for a national conference held in Saudi Arabia.

Initially, I hesitated about the conference in Saudi Arabia. It was a prestigious international event attracting the top minds in the energy-economics field. Even being selected felt like a dream. I wasn't sure if I was ready for this level of competition. However, my supervisor, who was a great mentor, encouraged me. He believed in me, saying, "Jameel, you can do it!" That really motivated me to write a paper. And guess what? I got selected to present at the conference!

This conference, held during my seventh semester, was fully funded. Presenting my research paper further boosted my confidence. It completely changed my perspective on the field. I began to understand the broader societal impact of our work in energy, especially how it can influence policy decisions. The conference also provided me with the opportunity to meet policymakers and leading professors in the field. It was truly the best exposure I could have hoped for.

Imagine a 21-year-old attending such a prestigious conference! It was a defining moment that shaped my future goals. Soon after that thrilling experience, I decided to pursue my Master's degree in this intersection of energy and economics. The months of November and December 2022 were some of the best of my college experience, thanks in part to the World Cup! We used to gather in the hostel common room to watch the matches, creating a fun and vibrant atmosphere. But academics took centre stage again after that.

Following the conference, with the last few months of my sixth semester approaching, many students started looking for mandatory internship opportunities. Fortunately, I secured an internship at a German Technical university. It was a fully-funded research internship program funded by the German government. They select only 80-100 students from all of India, and I was one of the lucky few chosen from a pool of over 1,000 applicants. My confidence and strong academic record definitely played a role in securing this incredible opportunity. I was excited to explore Germany! While I love South Asian countries, I've never been to Europe, and I wasfascinated by the prospect. The last two months of my sixth semester flew by, and just two weeks into my summer vacation, I was on my way to Germany.

Those two months in Germany were some of the best of my life. Beyond academics, the exposure and diversity I experienced were invaluable. Being part of a large international internship program and living in Europe was truly special. My internship focused on the intersection of energy and economics, specifically a comparative analysis of green hydrogen production in Germany and India. The project involved an economic viability study, exploring whether producing green hydrogen through solar integration would be financially feasible in both countries. The internship provided me with a deeper understanding of the research differences between India and Germany. It was a valuable learning experience overall. The work culture and overall mindset in Germany were completely different from what I experienced in India. The facilities, funding opportunities, and everything else were on another level entirely. Those two months were some of the best of my life, as I mentioned before. Every weekend, after finishing my work on Fridays, I'd pack a bag and travel. It wasn't a luxurious experience, but it was affordable and allowed me to explore Europe. All you need is a Visa to travel freely within most European countries.

Back in India for my sixth semester, I was working on an individual project. Nuclear energy fascinated me, and I explored the possibility of making it economically viable. It was a relatively new concept, and I was interested in its potential. I decided to develop a research paper on this topic. The paper focused on a comparative economic analysis of using nuclear energy for hydrogen production across three countries: South Korea, the US, and India. Once again, I got accepted to present my research at the 18th European IAEE Conference in Milan. Presenting at an international conference was a completely different experience compared to the national conference I attended earlier. It was a challenging but rewarding opportunity.  The audience, a group of academics, asked insightful questions, especially about nuclear energy, which is a highly debated topic. Despite some minor flaws, the presentation was a success. I showcased my ability to research and develop a compelling argument for the economic viability of nuclear energy for hydrogen production.

That marked the end of my European adventure. Returning to India was a bit of a culture shock compared to the more relaxed pace of life in Germany. It took me about two weeks to readjust and reconnect with my friends. I arrived about a month late in August and missed some classes. The placement season then began. However, I had already informed my placement coordinator that I wouldn't be participating. My goal was to pursue a Master's degree, and I had taken the previous semester off to travel and strengthen my application. While India offers good Master's programs in this field, the research and industry sectors aren't as developed as in other countries. Additionally, funding opportunities are scarce.  Therefore, I decided to pursue my Master's abroad, focusing on the investment opportunities and wider range of possibilities available in either Europe or the US. Ultimately, I chose the US.

Applying for graduate school involved a series of challenges, including exams, personal statements (SOPs), and recommendation letters. I applied to four universities and received acceptances from three of them by the end of my seventh semester.  Ultimately I chose to attend UC Davis. The Master's program at UC Davis is in Energy Systems Management and Policy, perfectly aligning with my career aspirations. This concludes my four-year journey, and I expect to begin my studies at UC Davis this fall.

It's been a truly diverse experience. From starting in Saudi Arabia to returning to India, and now back again in August, my life has been full of change. Throughout it all, I've had incredible support, especially from my parents. They backed my decisions even when they were unconventional. I was incredibly lucky to have such supportive parents. In terms of friends, there's one person I'd particularly like to mention: Shashwat. He was a senior by a year and a great mentor. He motivated us in all aspects of life, not just academics. He helped us navigate the personal side of things alongside the academic journey. It was important to find a balance and enjoy the experience, including travelling and making new friendships.

Ananta, a friend I met through my translation facade, is another important person. Originally from Jammu, she was initially trying to fit in with a different group. Over time, we got to know each other better, and she's become a close friend. We can be completely open and straightforward with each other, even when we disagree. However, the most significant influence on my academic journey has been my internship supervisors at IIT Ropar, Dr. Asad H Sahir and Sukriti Sharma, who guided me towards this path of Energy Management. They played a crucial role in shaping my academic direction and the field I'm pursuing today.

Looking back, I see a common challenge faced by many students in Indian institutions like the IITs and NITs. There's immense academic pressure, and students are expected to excel in academics and extracurricular activities simultaneously. Unfortunately, many get lost in the pursuit of balance and end up feeling overwhelmed or depressed.

My advice to juniors is to move away from the mentality of the "exam race" as a high-stakes competition.  It's not a failure if you don't get the top prize.  In engineering, not getting into an IIT doesn't define your success.  Life is about more than just rankings.  Sometimes, it's perfectly fine to be second, third, or even a finalist.  Your ability to excel goes beyond just test scores.

Personally, I could have chosen a more convenient option, like NIT Calicut, which is closer to my hometown and a top NIT.  However, I wanted to challenge myself in a new environment.  It wasn't about chasing the best option; it was about embracing a new experience and pushing myself out of my comfort zone.  This is a crucial lesson for juniors to understand.  Putting yourself in new environments teaches valuable skills.  Learning to adapt to new social situations and understand different cultures is an essential life skill.  Mastering this ability will make life much easier as you encounter new places and navigate different situations.

Honestly, in my first year, I didn't participate much in extracurricular activities.  Most people in my class groups spoke Bengali, and I felt a little lazy to talk to people outside my comfort zone. There weren't many new clubs established yet either. My first exposure to clubs came through a friend, Eshita. She posted a story about the E-Cell (Entrepreneurship Cell) on social media, and I mistakenly thought it had something to do with electronics.  Since I didn't know about clubs before, I missed out on joining earlier.  However, I eventually joined a few clubs related to chemical engineering and research in my later semesters.

Extracurricular activities are definitely valuable, but it's crucial to find a balance with academics. During my sixth semester, I had some very busy days, working until late night.  Despite that workload, I was still able to maintain a balance by efficiently managing my time and prioritizing tasks.  Time management is a skill that often gets overlooked, but it's essential for success.

Now, let's talk about personal relationships in college life.  In India, there's a certain expectation to explore relationships during college. I actually had some experience with relationships before college, but I believe everyone should experience a college romance at least once. It's not just about the act of being in a relationship, but about understanding the emotional aspects.  Learning how to connect with someone on a deeper level is a valuable life skill.  However, when I first arrived at college, I wasn't interested in relationships.  My priority was to adjust to the new environment and make the most of my educational opportunities.

For the first few months, I focused on getting to know the place, the people, and the overall college culture.  Coming from a different background, it wasn't always easy to connect with everyone.  Understanding the people around you is the first step before exploring romantic relationships.

Once you have that foundation, then you can start exploring your options. Your 20s are a sweet spot for personal growth.  It's a time to explore all aspects of life, including academics, relationships, and personal development.  Relationships, both casual and serious, can teach you valuable lessons about yourself and how to navigate more complex situations later in life. This is why I encourage everyone to explore relationships during their 20s.  It may not always be easy, especially for someone who moves around a lot like me, but finding the right person can be incredibly rewarding. 

My love for football actually began quite early.  I was only nine years old when I watched a World Cup match between Netherlands and Spain at my uncle's house.  That experience sparked a passion for the sport, and soon after, I found myself glued to the TV watching more games. Lionel Messi and his incredible 2010 Barcelona season, widely considered one of the best of all time, completely captivated me.  I was mesmerized by the things he could do with the ball.  While Messi introduced me to the sport, Barcelona became the club that truly made me fall in love with football and become a fan at such a young age.

Football has taught me many valuable lessons that extend far beyond the pitch.  Just like in fashion, where you can be stylish but still comfortable, in football you can put in a lot of hard work and dedication, but the outcome isn't always guaranteed.  There will be wins and losses, but the journey itself is what teaches you the most.  The dedication and perseverance required to chase a specific goal is a skill that translates well to other areas of life.

In addition to football, I was also very involved in athletics during my younger years.  As an athlete, I competed in sprints, particularly the 100 and 400 meters, and I frequently won medals.  Competition was a big motivator for me, and there was one particular rival I always seemed to face in the finals.  Beating him became a personal challenge.

From first grade to second grade, these competitions were a highlight for the entire school.  Everyone would be anticipating the "battle" between us, and it was even funnier because my competitor was actually my twin brother!  When competition becomes personal within a family, it adds another layer of pressure.  You don't want to be the one who loses to your own brother.

he rivalry continued and made us better in the sport.  By the tenth grade, I was fortunate enough to represent my state at the national level.  While I didn't win nationals, it was an incredible achievement to qualify.

Unfortunately, the pandemic disrupted my athletic pursuits.  However, my love for football never faded.  I continued to play casually with friends, especially during my third year, and I even participated in some social football clubs during my school days. After moving to India in tenth grade, both athletics and organized football became less of a focus, but my passion for the sport remains strong.

I've become more academically focused, but football remains a major part of my life. It's been a constant throughout my life.

Honestly, during the pandemic, movies and shows were my main form of entertainment besides classes. I'm not a big Bollywood fan, but there's a specific movie with Hrithik Roshan and another actor (I can't remember his name) that features a road trip across Spain. There's a song associated with that journey that captures the essence of my college experience – not just because I was in Europe, but because of the diversity of experiences I had. After two years of the pandemic, I came back to India in August, starting in Kerala before moving back to Saudi Arabia with my family, then travelling to various places before finally arriving here. I've always loved travelling and meeting new people. That song, particularly that specific part, from "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara" perfectly embodies the diversity and exploration that defined my college experience.

On campus, there isn't one specific place that stands out. As someone who isn't a big city person, there aren't many memorable places besides parks and common areas. However, a very special place for me is a senior's room in H Block, first floor (I don't remember the room number). It wasn't just me and Shashwat; Justin, Dharun and Siddhartan would come up too. We'd talk about everything from everyday things to planning for events like the World Cup. We'd hang out in his room, watch movies together, do random things, and create lasting memories. That room holds a special place in my heart.

For my juniors, my message is this: don't dwell on the past, live in the present, but be aware of the future. Be explorers of your time. Your 20s are a time to explore everything you can, to try new things, and ultimately figure out what you want to do in life. Having a sense of direction is crucial. As for myself, I keep chasing after a future version of myself. One movie that significantly impacted me was Interstellar. The concept of time in that film resonated deeply with me, and it's a big part of why I value time so much. I want to keep chasing the person I see myself becoming in 5 or 10 years, even if that vision changes over time. It's important to stay motivated and keep working hard. As a competitive person, I love chasing after something in the future. That's a challenge I'm always willing to take on.

Honestly, I wasn't always a boy with big dreams. I moved to India from a completely different world with no idea what I wanted to do. But by the end of my fourth year, I found something I'm passionate about.  It's amazing to be a part of this journey that began with no clear direction but has led me through so many different experiences.  So, to everyone who is unsure or doubtful about their future, take it easy. There will be a time when you find your purpose in life. It may not be easy to find, but I was fortunate enough to discover mine.  For those who haven't found their spark yet, just relax, explore, and embrace the experiences. Life is about the journey, not the destination. Be prepared for challenges, but keep moving forward.  That's the approach I've always taken, and it's served me well. It's an important quality for everyone, especially those who might be feeling down or lost, particularly in the demanding world of change. If things aren't going your way right now, take a breath. You will find something. You will find something good because life is a journey, and there's always something new to learn and master.

That's the message I want to leave you with – be explorers and pioneers of the new world.

My name is Sadhana Sharma, and my journey has been one of self-discovery, perseverance, and breaking barriers I never thought I could.

Looking back, I see a girl who once doubted herself, who feared failure, and who questioned whether she truly belonged in the world of engineering. Today, as I step into the professional world, I carry not just a degree but lessons that have shaped me into who I am.

I did my schooling in Uttarakhand until 8th grade. To be honest, as a child, I was not good at studies. My tuition teacher used to keep me back while others went home, often scolding me. I had no interest in academics until 6th grade—literally zero interest. I used to play a lot, and teachers often scolded me for not completing my homework or submitting projects on time. In fact, for every school project, I relied on my sister—she would always help me out. But somehow, I started loving to study. I made friends who encouraged me, and with them, I put in more effort. Teachers started recognizing me, and school became my favorite place.

Then suddenly, my parents decided to move to Bihar. It was a family decision that I had no say in. I cried and tried to convince my father, but nothing changed. But looking back now, I believe everything happens for a reason, and moving to Bihar was one of those things.

The school in Bihar was different. No extracurricular activities, just classes and home. I didn’t like it and made excuses every day to skip school. It wasn’t until midway through 10th grade that I made friends. Despite this, I slowly adapted. Mathematics felt like a puzzle I wanted to solve, and biology fascinated me, thanks to an inspiring teacher. When it came time to choose between PCM and PCB, I was torn.

The decision became clearer when my father encouraged me to sit for a scholarship exam. I filled out the form, unsure of what lay ahead. But as I solved the questions, something clicked—my love for problem-solving, logic, and structured thinking. Engineering started making sense. Winning the scholarship and securing a 75% fee waiver further cemented my decision.

But deciding to pursue engineering was just the beginning.  The real battle lay ahead: JEE preparation. Unlike many students who join top coaching institutes for JEE preparation, I studied in a regular school. My school did cover some JEE syllabus, but not with the intensity needed to crack the exam. This meant I had to rely heavily on self-study.At first, things went smoothly. I enjoyed studying and performed well in mock tests. But as topics grew tougher—especially in physics—self-doubt crept in. Circular motion, rotational mechanics, and electromagnetism felt impossible to grasp. I remember feeling overwhelmed, questioning whether I had made the right choice.

Despite the struggles, I kept going. I leaned on teachers, clarified my  doubts, and surrounded myself with friends who motivated me.  When my JEE Mains results came, they weren’t what I had hoped for. My rank wasn’t good enough for my dream colleges. I had a tough choice—settle for a lower-ranked college or take a drop year.

Taking a drop was not easy. The uncertainty was terrifying. But I knew I hadn’t given my best shot yet. Unlike many droppers who join intensive coaching programs, I couldn’t do that—it was the COVID-19 pandemic, and everything was shut down. Instead, I turned to online learning. I enrolled in a Physics Wallah course and followed it with complete dedication. Every day, I would wake up with a strict plan, making sure to cover every topic thoroughly. This time, I was not just studying—I was strategizing. I focused on my weak areas, solved numerous problems, and learned from my mistakes. When JEE Mains came around again, I was ready. My results improved significantly, and in the second last round of counseling, I secured a seat in NIT Agartala for Computer Science and Engineering.

Getting into NIT Agartala was a moment of joy, but also of apprehension.. I had never lived away from home before. Moving to the Northeast was a new experience altogether. I worried about language barriers, food differences, and cultural adjustments. Would I fit in? Would I be able to manage everything on my own?But all my fears faded once I stepped onto campus. The people were warm and welcoming. I also tried to  push myself beyond academics.
I tried debating, though public speaking wasn’t my strength. My first debate didn’t go well—I lost. But instead of being discouraged, I saw it as a chance to improve.

The transition from online to offline classes was another challenge. Initially, I was more comfortable talking to people over text and calls. But once we shifted to in-person interactions, I found myself hesitant. Meeting classmates face-to-face after months of virtual conversations was strange. I had to break out of my shell, approach people, and build real-life connections.

As my third year approached, I faced a new kind of pressure—internships and placements. The competition was fierce, and I knew that I had to be extremely disciplined to secure a good opportunity. I structured my preparation around key areas such as Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), which I practiced regularly on LeetCode. I also focused on strengthening my knowledge of Computer Science Fundamentals, including Operating Systems (OS), Database Management Systems (DBMS), and Networking. Additionally, I engaged in mock interviews to learn how to handle high-pressure situations effectively.

I also sought guidance from seniors, who helped me understand the recruitment process. Despite all the preparation, there were still setbacks. I faced rejections, and some interviews didn’t go as expected. One particular rejection hit me hard—I had cleared all rounds, received positive feedback, but wasn’t selected. I was devastated.

At that moment, someone close to me helped me see things differently. They reminded me, “This doesn’t define you. You’re capable. Keep going.” That conversation changed my mindset. Instead of dwelling on failure, I focused on learning from them.

Eventually, my persistence paid off. I cracked an on-campus internship with Warner Bros. Discovery, a leading media and entertainment company, and also secured a full-time offer at JPMC by participating in the Code For Good Hackathon 2024. The moment I saw my first salary credited into my account, it felt surreal. Telling my parents that I had earned my own money was one of the proudest moments of my life.

Throughout this journey, my family always supported me. My sister being my constant guide—I never felt alone in my journey. Their faith in me kept me going.

NIT Agartala gave me far more than just an education. It gave me friendships, leadership experiences, resilience, and confidence. I made lifelong friends—Gargi and Mission, who stood by me through everything. I’m also blessed to have a few more incredible people who will always be my lifelong well-wishers, supporting me no matter what.

Looking back, I wouldn’t change a thing. Every struggle, every failure, and every tough moment shaped me into who I am.

The advice I have for my juniors is to explore fearlessly—join clubs, participate in competitions, and step out of your comfort zone. Never hesitate to seek help from seniors, professors, or friends; people are more willing to help than you think. Speak up, share your thoughts, and don’t be afraid to ask questions. Build meaningful friendships and stay in touch with your seniors—they can guide you in ways you never imagined. Set targets, work towards them, and give your best in every opportunity and never underestimate yourself. Don’t think you can’t do it—at least give it a try! At times, you will feel overwhelmed, and that’s completely natural—it only means you care. In those moments, talk to someone who will listen, take a breather, and then get back to it. Keep trying, keep pushing, and trust me, you'll get there.

As I step into the corporate world, I know challenges will continue. But now, I carry the confidence that no hurdle is too big, no failure is final, and no dream is too far.

This is my story, and it’s just the beginning.

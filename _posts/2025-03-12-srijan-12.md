I come from a political family from the state of Bihar.

I was instinctively fascinated by the world of politics because of my family's strong foothold, however I developed a fascination for ISRO and space exploration. Initially, my goal was to join the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST), and for that, I began preparing for JEE Mains in 12th grade.
Starting JEE preparation late, I had an intense 12th-grade study routine while maintaining 75% attendance at Kendriya Vidyalaya. Without coaching, I relied on self-study, especially YouTube channels like PhysicsWallah. My dedication to IIST and ISRO pushed me to study tirelessly. My unwavering determination for IIST and ISRO, fueled my relentless study routine and I studied day and night, to the point where my parents had to remind me to get proper sleep. However, due to lack of seriousness in 11th grade, I was unable to clear JEE Advanced.
With decent JEE Mains scores, I had two choices—take a drop year or join NIT Agartala. My family advised against a drop because of involved uncertainties. After having a word with them, I enrolled myself at NIT Agartala.

 After joining NIT Agartala, I did have mixed feelings, yet, I was sure of one thing which was clear to me—to do something meaningful and be valued. Although, in my first semester, I struggled to find an avenue to live this. But, gradually, I learned about the various clubs in the institute that not only helped me establish myself but also provided a roadmap to trace my amazing journey at NIT-A.

 This voyage of exploration and self discovery first led me to the Debating Society of NLC. I also developed great passion and enthusiasm for basketball and ended up joining the college team. Winning the Inter-Branch championship in basketball continues to be a core first year memory for me.If I were to pick specific moments that stand out in my college life, I could list them as milestones that shaped me.Basketball is not just a game—it is a family. It gave me some of the best seniors, the best friends, and a sense of belonging in this institute. Everything I am today, in some way or another, I owe to that team.
 By my second year, I took on more responsibilities. I became the PR & Outreach Team Lead and a technical content writer for NLC. Then in the Entrepreneurship Cell as a Junior Core Team Member, the Social Media Team of the MUN Society, and became the Vice Captain of Menon House. In my third year, I founded and became the Vice President of the Business Club, transforming it from a small team into an official club. I joined BTC as a Manager, and now I am the Chairperson of BTC. I also became a Core Team Member of Sanganan Prayog and finally was selected as the General Secretary (GS) Technical of NIT Agartala.
I firmly believe that  the technical vertical should be the driving force of a technical institute like ours where benefiting students continue  contributing to its growth. Agartala, being a Tier-2 or Tier-3 city, has huge potential for innovation and business. There's an unexplored market, and we can build something that not only benefits the institute but also the entire region. By the time my tenure ends, I want to bring in MoUs with venture capitalists, so that in the future, when someone has an idea and a prototype, they don't have to struggle for funding. They'll have access to resources right here at our institute.
Coming from a political background, I have always loved interacting with people. When I first arrived here, I made a conscious effort to connect with people from different backgrounds. Every conversation, every interaction, allowed me to grow as a person. By meeting people from various backgrounds, I gained new perspectives, and that's something I cherish deeply.
Another key moment would be, organizing Aayam 9.0 in my second year which was a huge challenge, filled with uncertainty. But when it ended as a massive success, the feeling was unmatched. Standing on stage with the Gymkhana technical and BTC teams, dancing in celebration, and seeing everyone's joy felt surreal. At that moment, I knew—this was one of the best moments of my college life.

 When it comes to life here people have played an important role in my journey, my hostel friends have been a constant support system. My roommate, Nitin, has always been there for me, along with my close friends like Kirti, Ankit, Sahit, Aliyas, and Saurabh. Whenever I have had a problem, I could always count on them. And what I love the most is that they have a way of turning any serious situation into something light hearted. No matter how tense I am, they'll find a way to crack a joke and make me laugh, completely changing my mood.
On the extracurricular side, I have had the privilege of working with some amazing seniors and peers. When I was in my second year, I built a great relationship with the then GS and AGS Technical and Alumni. Omisha, Mansa, my current AGS Diya, Debaditya, and Swapnonil, became not just colleagues in extracurriculars but also good friends. Not to forget, through basketball, I have also formed strong bonds with my juniors, who I now consider among the best people I have met here. All of these people—whether friends from my hostel, seniors who guided me, or teammates from basketball—are like family to me. Whenever I am stressed or feeling low, I go to them, I talk to them, and automatically, I feel better.
Also, balancing academics and extracurricular activities are a key thing in college. I had a decent CGPA in my first year, but it did take a hit when I came in my second year and I have to manage both. But I quickly adapted. Learned how to balance—managing studies alongside all my ventures. And that paid off.
I always had an inclination towards leadership roles, being involved in multiple clubs and positions, I noticed that there wasn't a dedicated platform for students who were interested in business, startups, and entrepreneurship. Hence I wanted to create a space where students could learn about business strategies, networking, market analysis, and start-up incubation. Building something from scratch isn’t easy—it required recognition, engagement, and, most importantly, a team that shared the vision. We started small, organizing discussions and speaker sessions, gradually shaping a platform for students to explore business strategies, networking, and market analysis. My love for politics and leadership did play a significant role in why I started the Business Club. Politics, at its core, is about identifying gaps, bringing people together, and solving problems—and that's exactly what I did here.
I repeatedly pointed this out to my seniors, telling them that our goal should be to encourage students to become entrepreneurs, to create something of their own. But the focus had shifted. That's when I started feeling that my vision and the way E-Cell was operating weren't aligning. That's when me and my friend Swapnonil realized—we still wanted to work, we still wanted to build something. So why not build something that adds real value? That's how Business Club was born.
After founding the Business Club, we started working on meaningful initiatives. One of them was slayyin, a startup focused on student merchandise. We noticed a major gap in our institute—whenever a club wanted to make merch (t-shirts, hoodies, etc.), they struggled. They had to go back and forth between different vendors, and even then, they couldn't always get good quality products. This was a problem not just in our college, but in others as well. Slain was our solution to this gap, and it's still in the building phase.
Beyond that, the Business Club started organizing events that I always envisioned for. We hosted the Business Hackathon and we introduced Guesstimates. Now, why was Guesstimates important? When you sit for interviews in top companies—whether for Business Analyst roles, Product Management roles, or Finance roles—Guesstimates is something they will test you on. But nobody was teaching us this. It's not covered in our classes, and it's not something that E-Cell could focus on either, because their domain is startups. So the Business Club stepped in to fill that gap.
Another thing we started was Articulate to bridge the gap between technical brilliance and effective communication, where we trained in public speaking. Articulate became a space where even the fourth years participated enthusiastically, enhancing their technical communication skills. We uploaded these sessions online, ensuring that when people look up NIT Agartala, they see a place that fosters growth.

We launched the Product Design Workshop, a BTC and Business Club collaboration, to introduce students to product management—an emerging field once dominated by MBAs but now open to undergraduates. Many non-circuit students struggle with placements or don’t want core or coding jobs, and product management offers an alternative. Targeted at first-years, the workshop covers product thinking, UX/UI, and technical problem-solving, equipping them with industry-relevant skills early on.
My vision is to establish NIT Agartala as a technical leader among Northeast NITs by hosting competitions that attract top talent from other institutes. Showcasing our expertise will build a legacy of excellence, making NIT Agartala known for its technical prowess. This was central to my GS Technical PPD pitch, and by the end of my tenure, I aim to make it a reality.

 I want to create opportunities for Tripura’s school students, as they make up 50% of NIT Agartala. Early engagement through coding competitions, MUNs, and events will inspire them to join our institute and explore clubs even before college. Our goal is to make NIT Agartala a dream destination for them—because experiencing college-level events early pushes them to aim higher.

 Coming from a political background has shaped who I am today. Unlike many who enter politics later in life, I've had the privilege of understanding its nuances from a grassroots level. My father, an active politician for over four decades, has been my greatest inspiration. I've seen first-hand how politics is about responsibility and creating meaningful change, not just power.
This background gives me an edge because I understand both the practical and strategic sides of politics. I have seen what works and what doesn't, how policies are made, how governance functions, and how public opinion shapes leadership. I have also had the opportunity to interact with political leaders, attend events, and analyse how narratives are built.
My long-term plan is clear—I want to enter politics, but I don't want to do it unprepared. That's why I am currently focusing on building financial independence, gaining experience in business and management, and expanding my network. I believe that when I step into politics, I should be in a position where I am not financially dependent on it, so that I can truly work for the people and not be bound by compromises.
Coming from a political background, one thing that has always been ingrained in me is confidence. I know that no matter what, I can stand in front of one lakh people and speak without hesitation. Because at some point in life, I have to do that. It's something I've seen firsthand, something I've prepared for. Growing up, I used to watch news debates not just for information, but for entertainment. I absorbed how political figures answer questions, how real-world debates work, and how people react to different speaking styles. That's why today, when I enter a Model United Nations (MUN) debate, a sponsorship meeting, or a public event, I already understand the psychology of speaking.
Coming from a political family taught me how to connect across generations. Engaging with elders from all ages at home shaped my ability to adapt my communication—whether negotiating with sponsors, coordinating with staff, or speaking in debates. Leadership isn’t just about decisions; it’s about understanding people, and that’s the biggest skill I’ve brought to this institute.
To sum up how I'd like to be remembered, it would be simple: "Banda sahi hai." Not necessarily the nicest or most easy-going guy, but someone who was fundamentally good and genuine. When people hear the name Srijan Malik, I want them to think of someone who was fair, principled, and committed to building something meaningful. I don't claim to be perfect—I've had moments of anger and frustration—but if people recognize that beneath all that, I was genuinely trying to make a positive difference, then that's enough for me.
For students joining or already at NIT Agartala, my advice is straightforward—this is a good institute. It may not have the same recognition as some top-tier IITs, but that doesn't define its worth. I've seen seniors secure impressive job packages, go abroad, and achieve remarkable success. The issue isn't the institute's potential; it's just that the name isn't as widely recognized in other parts of India. But those who work hard and seize opportunities here excel tremendously.
To my juniors, I say—believe in this institute. Don't let external opinions discourage you. NIT Agartala has given me so much, and whatever I achieve in the future, I'll owe to this place. With dedicated effort, this institute provides everything needed for success.
There's a misconception that if you're handling multiple things—societies, leadership roles, startups—you have to let go of academics. But I believe that maintaining all-round excellence is crucial. Because at the end of the day, no matter what you do in college, your knowledge, discipline, and work ethic will always matter. So if you're reading this story, don't forget that—I have balanced everything while keeping my academics strong.
This is a beautiful institute with countless opportunities. Yes, we face challenges—being in a remote location, dealing with administration, navigating the system—but this is our institute. What puzzles me is when students go online only to highlight negatives. When ranking committees or prospective students search for NIT Agartala and find predominantly negative content, it hurts our perception ranking and ultimately affects placements. What do we gain from this? Are we helping future students? No, we're damaging our own reputation.
Instead of tearing down the institute, let's work together to improve it. Because in 10 years, all that will remain are memories. I'd rather look back and say, "I helped build something better," than "I was part of the problem." At the end of the day, this is our college. Our institute. Let's leave behind something we can be proud of.

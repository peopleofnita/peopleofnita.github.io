title: "Go With The Flow (#8 Manish Rohila)"
---

My entire education, from a local private school in Jaipur, was in Hindi medium.

In 10th grade, I excelled particularly in mathematics, and following the principle of "going with the flow," I chose PCM (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics) for 11th grade, like many of the top students in my class. The transition proved challenging, especially with trigonometry, but I persevered, supplementing my studies with RD Sharma's books since the state board materials weren't sufficient for competitive exams.

In 12th grade, around July, while my friends began JEE preparation, I wasn't initially interested in engineering. Many were pushed by their parents, but mine wanted me to join the family business. My father, who runs an irrigation company, hoped I'd pursue a BSc degree from a local private college and join him. However, I felt the need to prove myself independently first. Starting JEE preparation in September , I managed to qualify with a good percentile for the Advanced exam, though I didn't secure a seat in an IIT.

Watching IIT students on YouTube—their campus life, cultural fests, high placements, and everything else—really inspired me. It made me want to experience that for myself, so I joined Utkarsh Classes in Jodhpur for another attempt. When the pandemic hit in March 2020, we switched to online classes, which was particularly challenging as I prefer in-person learning. With this being my final chance before joining my father's business, and despite his scepticism and ongoing family difficulties, I remained determined.

A crucial turning point was switching from Hindi to English medium for JEE preparation. Though isolating, especially with online classes preventing interaction with friends, I adapted to both the language change and the conceptual NCERT syllabus. I filled nearly 20 rough copies just for math practice, despite initially scoring low in math during my first JEE attempt. In 2021, when NTA offered four attempts, I finally secured a good enough percentile to qualify for Advanced and secure a college seat.

During this period, I also explored a career in the defense sector, with full support from my family, especially my father who appreciated the government job benefits. I joined mock SSB interview classes as restrictions eased, but quickly realized my physical fitness needed work, I couldn't clear basic obstacles and weighed 85 kg. Dedicated to improvement, I managed to reduce my weight to 67 kg, though this meant temporarily pausing my JEE preparation.

After receiving interview calls from all three branches of the Armed Forces, I focused on the Indian Army. The mock interviews were a learning experience, particularly in improving my communication skills. While I'm stronger in written English, the mock interview process taught me to speak more freely and share thoughts openly. Though I wasn't selected, receiving the results on June 8th, the entire experience proved invaluable. Travelling alone from Jaipur to Bangalore during lockdown, with special permissions required, was a significant step in personal growth.

Returning to JEE Advanced preparation was challenging, especially while dealing with emotional drain Army rejection.

Though I attempted the JEE Advanced, I didn't qualify but secured a seat in Electronics and Instrumentation at NIT Agartala during counselling. My college journey began uniquely, with first-semester classes held online due to COVID-19. Despite the virtual format, I quickly formed friendships, particularly with students from Bihar. We created unofficial study groups, eagerly anticipating the switch to offline classes. My cousin, later learned, was studying the same branch at NIT Agartala, which I hadn't known when joining.

When offline classes were announced, everyone was really excited. I travelled to Tripura with my parents and sister, alongside many other NIT students on the same train. Though my parents planned to stay longer, they returned the next day due to closed facilities. The cultural shift was significant, especially regarding food habits, being strictly vegetarian in a predominantly non-vegetarian culture, though I eventually adapted and tried non-vegetarian food.

I arrived on campus on April 7, 2022, and was assigned to the new R&T hostel. I met my roommate, Karan, while doing some official work for hostel allocation. He was known for solving tough maths problems during online exams, and we became close friends. I also connected with Aayush from our unofficial group chat and his roommate, Chaitanya. The weather contrast with Rajasthan was stark, with humidity and sudden rains requiring adjustment. While mess food wasn't great, it wasn't a major concern.

Following our seniors' advice to explore beyond academics, I joined the handball team under the guidance of Shyam Bhaiya. After dedicated practice, we represented our college in the 2023 All India Inter-NIT Tournament. Balancing sports with academics was challenging, especially in our demanding branch. I also began learning coding, starting with C++ basics through YouTube tutorials, though maintaining my CGPA remained the priority.

The third semester brought academic challenges, with a particularly strict professor leading to lower grades than expected. This realization pushed me to focus more intensely on core subjects while managing sports and coding preparation. In the third year, seeking an internship became a priority.

Despite the market downturn and limited opportunities for Electronics and Instrumentation students, after roughly 300+ applications, I secured a web development internship with a Delhi-based start-up named Sellerkin. This experience included successfully deploying a project on Azure and creating a college website project on Render, though it crashed within two days due to high traffic, a valuable learning experience.

The fifth semester brought significant personal challenges, including bullying and harassment within my friend circle. Despite multiple complaints to authorities, little action was taken, possibly due to the perpetrator's claimed mental health issues. This period significantly impacted my studies and mental well-being, though it taught me valuable lessons about handling authorities and recognizing true friends. The situation improved after a break when the person involved began treatment.

During summer break, I dedicated myself to improving both my CGPA and coding skills, spending long hours in the library from 9 AM to 10 PM. When placement season began in fourth year, I faced several interviews, starting with PhonePe where I cleared the online assessment but not the final interview. My friend Chaitanya provided invaluable support, helping with interview preparation and communication skills.

After interviews with Future-First and GlobalLogic, I interviewed with GE Vernova. Though they initially sought only CSE students, they gave me a chance after a 90-minute technical interview where I solved seven coding questions. The HR round lasted 45 minutes, notably longer than the usual 20 minutes. The news of my selection came on August 29th at 12:10 PM, leading to an emotional video call with my parents.

Looking back, I believe the key to college success is finding genuine friends who support you through difficulties. While relationships may develop, they shouldn't become a desperate pursuit. The first two years should be about exploration and making mistakes, though avoiding conflicts is crucial as even innocent parties can face consequences.

My perspective on college life has evolved significantly. I found the constant companionship in hostel life overwhelming. However, I've grown to appreciate these experiences, understanding that problems come and go, making you stronger. Even the initial challenges with vegetarian food and infrastructure have become cherished memories.

I want to be remembered as someone genuine and truthful, always there for friends and direct in communication. If something disturbed my peace of mind, I spoke up, even if it meant losing friendships. Whether as a roommate, partner, or friend, I never denied help, be it financial, educational, or life advice.

The movie "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara" resonates with my college experience, the theme that life won't come again. College is like a four-year bachelor's party, but with responsibilities. It teaches you to manage finances, balance family expectations, maintain friendships, and enjoy life on a limited budget.

The biggest lesson I've learned is the importance of discipline and consistency. Whether in coding, relationships, or personal growth, taking every problem as a learning opportunity and maintaining consistency is crucial. As my college journey concludes, I appreciate how this phase has shaped me, teaching me to live life fully while managing responsibilities and limited resources.
